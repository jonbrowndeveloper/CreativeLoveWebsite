        <h2>Who is Creative Love Church?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="lead">
            Creative Love Church is a church plant getting ready to launch in the spring of 2018. Here at Creative Love Church we are passionate about showing Jesus' creative love towards humanity. Whether it's at our homes, neighborhoods, schools, work or across the globe, we want to tangibly express God's creative love for humanity through the local church. Our goal is not necessarily to become the next "cool" church, but rather strive to see God do powerful miracles through the church. Miracles that brings about real transformation in people, cities, states and eventually nations. We are encourage by the knowledge that Jesus is building His church, which are people, not buildings. Our purpose is to empower and equip people to live and lead the life that God has destined them to live.

        <h3>Our Beliefs</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            <b>We believe:</b>
        <ul class="list-unstyled text-md-left">
            <ul>
                <li>That the Bible is the inspired Word of God. It is accurate, authoritative, and applicable to our everyday lives.</li>

                <li>We believe in one eternal God who is the Creator of all things. He exists in three Persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. He is totally loving and completely holy.</li>

                <li>We believe that sin has separated each of us from God and His purpose for our lives.</li>

                <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ as both God and man is the only One who can reconcile us to God. He lived a sinless and exemplary life, died on the cross in our place, and rose again to prove His victory and empower us for life.</li>

                <li>We believe that in order to receive forgiveness and the ‘new birth’ we must repent of our sins, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and submit to His will for our lives.</li>

                <li>We believe that Jesus established and is building His Church. God’s plan is that all believers regularly meet together for worship, fellowship, service, and instruction in the Word of God.</li>

                <li>We believe in water baptism for every believer.</li>

                <li>We believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is available to all believers. The Holy Spirit enables us to use spiritual gifts as enumerated in I Corinthians 12-14 and as manifested in the Early Church, including speaking in tongues.</li>

                <li>We believe that God wants to heal and transform us so that we can live healthy and blessed lives in order to help others more effectively.</li>

                <li>We believe that God has a plan and purpose for each of our lives and that He enables us by His grace to grow in love, maturity, and relationship with Him.</li>

                <li>We believe that each person will exist eternally. Whether we spend eternity with God or separated from Him is determined by our response to the grace and salvation of Jesus.</li>
                <li>We believe that Jesus will come back again for the Church as He promised.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 align="center">Our Pastors</h3>
        <p class="lead text-center">
            Noe and Bertha Lara are emerging leaders for their generation committed to seeing the local church thrive in today’s society and culture. As of 2017, Noe and Bertha began the process of planting Creative Love Church in Bloomington, MN where they began to meet at a local coffee shop. Pastor Noe and Bertha’s vision is to make God’s creative love known to the twin cities through the message of Jesus and by the love of the local church empowering every person to live and lead the life that God has planned for them. Noe and Bertha have 4 amazing children, Nolan, Julian, Zoe and Alexa. The Lara’s enjoy life. Away from ministry they love spending time as a family enjoying a good movie they can all sit and watch as well as a good nerf gun battle.

        <h3 align="center">Creative Kids</h3>
        <p class="lead text-center">
            Jesus is creative and knows how to have fun! This is our heart and soul in everything we do. Our kids department puts an emphasis on fun and creative and designs activities where kids discover who Jesus is in a personal way.
        </p>

        <h3 align="center">Gatherings</h3>
        <p class="lead text-center">
            When we gather people under one roof we want all the attention to point to Jesus. Whether through prayer, worship, giving or the message, our goal is to know Jesus more. Something spectacular happens when believers gather in one place: faith is restored, hope is provided, healing occurs and relationships are formed.
            <br><br>
            We currently meet for church service on Sunday mornings at 10:30 am in a home in Burnsville. We are transitioning to a larger location and expect to move in September 2018.
